Text-based Personality prediction for MBTI Dimension

Text analysis in natural language processing (NLP) involves sequential input data processing. It is important to understand and capture the context when working with the sequential data as the input has dependency and correlation with the surrounding texts input. Recent researches have shown neural network models outperform the result of the machine learning model where contextual processing of the input is required. Contextual processing is needed to understand the input text meaning correctly. Here, I used the neural network model LSTM and GRU with an attention mechanism for contextual processing of the text to predict the different personality type dimensions defined by the Kaggle MBTI dataset. The kaggle MBTI dataset provides dimensions with 16 different personality traits based on the texts. This experiment focuses on the contextual modulation approach for analysing the input texts while predicting the personality traits of the individual.
